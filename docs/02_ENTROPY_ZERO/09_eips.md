# EIPs

An ENTROPY Improvement Proposal (EIP) is a mechanism by which an improvement to some aspect of the project can be proposed, evaluated, voted on, and implemented. Currently three EIPs have been proposed and all have been approved. Below are TL;DR summaries and the verbatim proposals for each EIP as posted in the Discord [#miner-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1247287358022225960/1258269107699322982) channel.

## EIP1
* Proposed: September 09, 02024 
* Passed: September 09, 02024

### TL;DR

   The previous full score cutoff of 50% shall be increased to 80%. This means that 80% of miners shall now receive a full score of 1 and the remaing 20% shall receive a linearly decreasing score terminating at 0.

### Proposal

> Dear Comrade @miner 
>
> We are happy to announce the very first ENTROPY Improvement Proposal EIP1.
>
> As you are very well aware, the powerful forces of degenerate capitalism are ever conspiring against us to take food from your hard earned plates. The creed of "miners eat first" is forever being undermined by venture capitalists and degenerate traders. We are all here because we know that the miner is the cornerstone of any crypto economy and deserves their just reward. It is therefore concerning to us that we see some miners hoarding wealth, instead of sharing it with their comrades-in-arms.
>
> Yes, it came to us as a surprise as well, and there should be no confusion as to why this was so. For, no, it was not due to an unforeseen avarice that we find ourselves in this situation today. Your central committee has done a thorough analysis and found no cupidity or covetousness in our community of miners.
>
> What we have instead found is a misalignment in the incentive structure of our network, for it has become obvious to us that rewarding the top 50% of miners for their hard work unfairly disadvantages the majority of the remainder. Our analysis shows that the vast majority of the bottom 50% are trustworthy miners just as worthy of equal reward as the rest, yet they suffer so that those at the top may benefit.
>
> To bring more detail to the situation at hand:
The current 50% cutoff was set before the beginning of the revolution. It was a precarious time and unclear how many comrades within our midst would remain loyal.
> As it stands, we have only caught two non-believers since launch and both were in the bottom 10% of earners at the time of their transgressions.
> The way scoring works, those who remain connected longer, i.e., make more consecutive reports, are rewarded more than the same hard-working comrades who have a shorter history of consecutive reports.
> This creates a situation where early miners are doubly rewarded for being early, i.e., for mining longer and for achieving a better score.
> Exacerbating the situation is that many early miners have multiple credentials, either because they have had more time to gain one, or because it was easier to receive one in the past.
> 
> We are not in the business of growing inequality amongst miners. We are in the business of nothingness: that each miner may eat. Therefore, Comrades, it is only right that we increase the 50% cutoff to 80%.
>
> Note that the linear decrease from a score of 1 to a score of 0 will remain, but the drop in score will start at the 80th percentile instead of the 50th. This is a simple change but required so that our mission of entropy may continue and that we may all eat first.
>
> Please join your Professor hand in hand and vote for what is right. Entropy depends on you.

## EIP2
* Proposed: October 13, 02024 
* Passed: October 13, 02024

### TL;DR

   When a Discord member with multiple mining credentials jeets from one miner / wallet, [The Second Law](/ENTROPY_ZERO/tokenomics#the-second-law) shall be applied not just to the one miner / wallet that jeeted, but to all the miners / wallets associated with the Discord member. This means that The Second Law shall be multiplied by the number of miners / wallets associated with the Discord member and applied to all their miners / wallets.
   This EIP applies only to the fortunate few that have multiple mining credentials. 

### Proposal

> Dear @miner 
>
> The present danger from snakes requires the need for ENTROPY Improvement Proposal EIP2.
>
> All of us are familiar with the text of The Second Law. What has come to pass is a lack of familiarity with the spirit of The Second Law.
>
>Multi-credentialed miners mine amongst us, generating entropy in seeming camaraderie and love toward their fellow hole diggers. However, not all is as it seems. The multi-credentialed have been taking many of us for fools!
>
> When we mine, they jeet! When we dig, they park their shovel in the ground, watch, and laugh!
>
> The behavior takes a particularly sinister form, with multi-credentialed miners allowing themselves to jeet from one wallet while their others wallets claim the fruit of labor. The situation has become intolerable!
> 
> Luckily, your good professor proposes a solution: ████ ███ ███ █████ █████ ████ ██ ████████ ██ ███ ██████ ███ ██ ██████████ ██ ███ ██████ ██ ███████████ ████ █████
>
> ████ ██████ ██ ██ ██████████ █████ █ ████████████ ████ ████ ████ █ █████ ██ █ ███████ ██ ███ ██████ ████
> 
> Nothing changes for those with one credential. Nothing changes for those who do not jeet at the expense of others.
>
> Please join me and vote to prevent the degenerate jeeting that threatens to upend our great community.
>
> Miners. True miners. Eat. First.

## EIP3
* Proposed: November 12, 02024 
* Passed: November 12, 02024

### TL;DR
   All miners ranked above the bottom 25 shall receive a full score of 1. Additionally, those below this threshold shall no longer receive a linearly decreasing score, but rather a fixed score of 0.05.

### Proposal

> Dear Comrade @miner 
>
> Rapid progress and securing a hope for the future necessitates the urgent passage of ENTROPY Improvement Proposal EIP3.
>
> As you are very well aware, to be worthy of the name "miner", one is expected to dig a hole. This shows a spirit of camaraderie and egalitarian agreeableness expected of all who proudly hold the miner's shovel and wear the miner's helmet. Once inside our hallowed halls, however, there should be no expectation of having to prove oneself repeatedly. Yet herein lies a present concern, voiced frequently by so many of our comrades.
>
> The concern is that of not having enough to eat. Many miners toil endlessly, yet are frequently ranked in the bottom 20%, meaning that they miss out on their justly earned rewards.
>
> How can we call ourselves egalitarian when those who perform less successfully are treated differently? Is it brotherly—or otherly—to overlook the efforts of those striving to fulfill their entropic duties?
>
> Nevertheless, requiring a modicum of higher performance is not without reason, for there exists the concern that some who rank low may not truly deserve a place among the rest. Though no such snake currently lurks within our ranks, the danger remains ever-present and ever-menacing. Thus, it is with regret that we must deny requests for equal treatment across all ranks, as this would mean granting an equal score to all.
>
> For context, prior to EIP1, the threshold for a full score required performance in the top 50%. With the passing of EIP1, this threshold rose to 80%—a reasonable adjustment as we grew from 100 to nearly 250 miners. With our numbers now approaching 500, one might suggest lowering the threshold to the top 90%. However, doing so would likely necessitate future improvement proposals, a situation we prefer to avoid.
>
> It is therefore proposed that all miners ranked above the bottom 25 shall receive a full score. Additionally, those below this threshold will no longer receive a linearly decreasing score, but rather a fixed score of 0.05.
>
> It is to be understood that this proposal will most impact new miners, who start at the bottom of the ranks. Lowering the threshold will hasten the pace at which they join the ranks of their brethren.
>
> Please extend your hardworking hand to your fellow miner and vote for what is right.
