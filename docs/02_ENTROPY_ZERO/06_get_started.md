# Get started

To join ENTROPY, one may apply for a role as a miner by joining the Discord server:

https://discord.gg/puredepin

## Mining

With this role, a miner is guaranteed at least one mining credential, allowing them to connect their mining device to the server. Each credential is uniquely linked to:

- A Solana address
- A firmware binary provided to the miner to be flashed on an ESP32 or ESP32-S3 device

See [firmware guides](../category/firmware-guides) for instructions on how to flash.

## Equipment

Mining requires an ESP32 or ESP32-S3 device. These inexpensive devices can be
purchased through online retailers. You can read more about ESP32 on the
ESPRESSIF website:
